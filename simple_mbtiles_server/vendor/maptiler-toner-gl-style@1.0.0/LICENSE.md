Original design has ISC license
https://github.com/stamen/toner-carto/blob/master/LICENSE

Attribution for the design defined in this repository needs not to be provided
on map images, but should be reasonably accessible from maps based on this style
(for example, in a webpage linked from copyright notice on the map).

Products or services using maps derived from OpenMapTiles schema need to visibly
credit "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "OpenMapTiles" with a link to
https://openmaptiles.org/.
An exception has been granted: required copyright on this style is (C) MapTiler.

For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the
credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

[© MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/copyright/)
[© OpenStreetMap contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

For printed and static maps a similar attribution must be made in a textual
description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.

Exceptions to OpenMapTiles attribution requirement can be in a written form granted
by MapTiler AG (info@maptiler.com).
The project contributors grant MapTiler AG the license to give such exceptions on
a commercial basis.
